# Optimization-Methods
Using some advanced optimization methods can speed up learning and perhaps even get you to a better final value for the cost function. 
* Having a good optimization algorithm can be the difference between waiting days vs. just a few hours to get a good result.

## In this project we would be applying
* Optimization methods such as (Stochastic) Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam
* Use random minibatches to accelerate convergence and improve optimization
